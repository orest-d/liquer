# LiQuer (Link Query) 

LiQuer is a minimalistic python framework on top of flask, which simplifies creation of web services and web interfaces,
particularly in connection to data science: working with data frames, charts and reports.
The core of LiQuer is a simplistic query language, that can represent a chain of transformations (*commands*)
applied to an arbitrary data object (e.g. a dataframes, text, json, images). LiQuer query is safe to use inside URLs
and is interpreted and executed by a LiQuer server that is available as a flask blueprint.
LiQuer is very modular and designed to be extremely easy to extend (typically just by simple decorators and use of conventions).
Results of LiQuer queries can be cached for added performance.

# Install

```
pip install liquer-framework

# TODO

- [x] improve command catalogue (in progress)
- [x] support for dataframe iterator - kind of supported by pickling
- [x] namespaces
- [x] lift the requirement for a state to be cloneable - at least for some data types
- [x] make indicator of *volatile* state, that can never be cached (volatile=immutable?)
- [x] specify metadata in command decorator
- [x] cache categories/levels dependent on metadata
- [x] basic keras support
- [x] basic scikit support
- [x] composite state (djson)
- [x] meta extension

- [x] read/write of metadata independent from data

- [x] sub-queries as arguments
- [x] automatic dependent query recording via a context
- [x] debugging via context
- [x] messages and progress report via context
- [x] implied volatile (query result dependent on a volatile query should be volatile)

- [x] optional metadata storage in SQL - to support Hive
- [x] proper encoding of file cache
- [x] cache remove key 

- [x] progress reporting GUI
- [x] process monitoring GUI
- [x] parallel execution of multiple queries

- [x] test and fix bug with incorrect query used in error reporting of link expansion (implement reporting query)
- [x] resource path in ~X link

- [x] default store for webapp extensions
- [x] configurable frontend - kind-of possible with web store
- [x] human readable metadata extract and store report (can be improved, but the basic functionality is there)

- [ ] cashing store (to be used e.g. with a database store)
- [ ] metadata for external files in store
- [ ] expiration for files in store
- [ ] expiration for cache
- [x] progressive metadata storing when evaluating to store
- [x] data characteristics generated by state type
- [x] clean recipes store - remove recipes, but keep external files
- [x] on change action in store, dir summary
- [x] get_context function to create context
- [ ] default data-science app example
- [x] more powerful recipes - description and url/file links, nested structure ?
- [ ] store to_dict and from_dict
- [x] ignore dot directories in recipes store in order to support jupyter notebooks
- [x] file-system paths and url links to physical file in store (when possible)
