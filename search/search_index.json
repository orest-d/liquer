LiQuer is a versatile tool - it helps to create interactive dashboards and web applications, working with tables, creating charts, images, reports - but as well non-interactive batch processes. The core of Liquer is a minimalistic query language, that represents a sequence of actions as a compact (but still human readable) string, or as URL \"link\". (Hence the name Link Query.) The second pillar of LiQuer is metadata: LiQuer always keeps track of metadata associated with the data. LiQuer queries can * execute interactively in a browser, * execute non-interactively in a batch, * referenced in reports, * efficiently cache the final and intermediate results, * improve the transparency, traceability and discoverability by the use of metadata - and more. Design of LiQuer is guided by the following principles: Simplicity and flexibility - Make simple things simple, complex things possible. Batteries included - Provide useful features and integration of 3rd party libraries out of the box in a modular way. Don't stand in the way - collaborate! - Do not force one way of doing things. Be technology neutral and integrate well with other libraries and frameworks. LiQuer-enabled code should run as well without the framework and thus using LiQuer should be low risk in terms of dependencies. Make all parts modular, replaceable and customizable. LiQuer is extremely easy to use - just decorate ordinary python functions with a simple decorator. LiQuer provides integration of essential data-science tools like Pandas, Scikit-Learn and Keras without having a hard dependency on these frameworks - you need them only when you are going to use them. LiQuer's main web-framework is Flask (because of its simplicity), but other frameworks can easily be supported (there is a basic Tornado support available, others will follow as needed). LiQuer enabled code can be used (in most cases) exactly the same way as if LiQuer would not be there - so no LiQuer knowledge is needed to use your code. That makes it easy for newcommers to use the existing code, but as well start quickly contributing to a LiQuer-enabled code base. Three use-cases + two more LiQuer was born from three quite different use-cases: * When preparing the presentation on a larger demographics dataset, we have had many questions in mind: What if we show the results ony for the students? How is the geographic distribution? How is the geographics distribution of students? Can we show it graphically? Can we see the raw data in a spreadsheet? The questions started to multiply. There were too many questions to prepare a slide for each possibility and the Jupyter notebooks were too technical for the end-users. We needed to have some interface flexible enough to express all these demands in a simple form... * We have been contributing to a large effort of consolidating data scraped from multiple sources. This has been usually performed by batch jobs, sometimes by specialized proxies. Proxy approach seems very promissing - data is fresh, on demand and there is no trouble with batch job monitoring - but proxies are not simple to construct. If only there would be a way how to make a flexible universal proxy, that would support tasks like filtering, basic processing and some visualization... * When preparing an implementation of an important complex machine learning model in production, many questions about model reliability, expected performance, monitoring and ethical concerns have been raised. We have been producing report after report, presentation after presentation and we needed to document all the aspects of the model development in a concise, transparent and reproducible way. A single data scientist can perform several analytic tasks a day - and a small team can easily create several hundreds of artefacts (reports, charts, data sets, numerical experiments) per month. It is very easy to loose track of what exactly has been done and how. It is difficult to refer to all those calculations and document them in such a way that they can be reproduced: it is not practical to have several hundred scripts and/or document several hundred ways of how the scripts can be configured. If there only would be a way to represent all those calculations in a concise way - and possibly refer to them via URLs... After LiQuer was created, there appered more and more ways how to use it: * Data scientists often store intermediate results to accelerate the development. LiQuer provides two natural ingrediences for a cache: a) each step of the pipeline has a natural key and b) each result has a defined way how to deal with serialization (which format to use or whether the data is serializable at all). Metadata can be used to control the caching mechanism - e.g. prevent caching of sensitive data to support GDPR compliance. * Metadata allow discoverability and traceability of all the artefacts - all data sets, filters and reports can be equipped with tags and searchable from an user interface. This can be a big help for knowledge sharing. Data can be (in somo cases automatically) equipped with supplementary informations like required access rights, persons to contact, pointers to source code or SQL queries. Hello, world! Let's start with a Hello, world! example: from liquer import * @first_command def hello(): return \"Hello\" @command def greet(greeting, who=\"world\"): return f\"{greeting}, {who}!\" print (evaluate(\"hello/greet\").get()) print (evaluate(\"hello/greet-everybody\").get()) What is happening here? There are two functions: hello and greet . Both of them are turned into \"commands\" with the decorators ( @first_command and @command ). This means, that they are \"published\" and can be called via a web interface. In this example, we just call them via the evaluate function. Evaluate accepts a LiQuer query, which consists out of a chain of slash-separated commands; output of each command becomes an input of a next command. What is at the beginning of the chain? As you might have guessed, it is None . However, to avoid passing meaningless arguments - and to highlight that some commands are meant to be \"the first command\" in the pipeline, there is the @first_command decorator. The only difference between the @first_command and @command if that the @first_command does not get the first argument from the previous step. (If such a command appears in the middle of a query, the query before the first_command is effectively ignored.) The complete query hello/greet calls function hello() and then passes the return value as a first argument of greet - i.e. hello/greet is equivalent to greet(hello()) . Commands can as well pass arguments to the functions, which are dash-separated, i.e. hello/greet-everybody query is equivalent to python expression greet(hello(), \"everybody\") . This way multiple function calls can be combined in a single query, which may combine data fetching, filters, various analysis/calculations with parameters and visualizations. Of course, the arguments must be represented as strings in the query. LiQuer takes care of proper escaping and type conversion. LiQuer always keeps track of the metadata associated with the data. Metadata contain various supplementary data useful e.g. for debugging and tracking the data source - e.g. the query itself. Metadata can be enhanced by the user in several ways. The combination of data and metadata is the State object. The State object is as well returned by evaluate . The main payload (the \"data\") is extracted from State using the get() method.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-liquer","text":"LiQuer is a leightweighted open-source framework (see repo ) covering a large number of usecases associated with machine learning, data science and other computational experimentation tasks requiring flexible analysis.

One such example is HDX disaggregation wizard. It is a tool solving a simple task: splitting (disaggregating) a single data sheet (csv or xlsx) into multiple sheets. Sheet is split by values in the specified column (or multiple columns). Since this is a quite generic task (related to group by ), this functionality is built into liquer.ext.lq_pandas . The core of this feature is the eq command, filtering dataframe by specific values in a column, e.g. eq-a-123 keeps in the dataframe only rows where column a is 123. Command eq (equal) accepts multiple column-value pairs, e.g. eq-a-123-b-234 . In HDX the convention is to use the first row for tags. To support this comvention, teq command (tag equal) always keeps the first row of the dataframe. The disaggregation service supports both tagged and untagged data, using either eq or teq for filtering, depending on the user input. The complete flow is simple: * fetch data (command df_from ) * find unique values in a column (or multiple columns) and use them to create a list (table) of queries (command split_df ) * the queries use eq (or teq ) to filter dataframe by value(s). So, use a query like df_from-URL/split_df-COLUMN and you will get a table with queries like df_from-URL/eq-COLUMN-VALUE1 , df_from-URL/eq-COLUMN-VALUE2 . A little detail regarding the split function: There are actually four versions of this function - depending whether it is used for tagged or untagged document and whether it is quick (or query ) splits or full splits. The quick version only provides raw LiQuer queries (not the complete URL), The full split ( split_df for untagged and tsplit_df for tagged data) execute all the split queries, which might be slow. As a side effect, the results are cached (depending on the configuration, the example is using FileCache('cache') ). The complete user interface is in a single html file hdx_wizard.html , served by the flask server. Inside the user interface, LiQuer service is called multiple times e.g. to get previews or metadata: * Data previews uses the ability of LiQuer lq_pandas to convert dataframes to json, which can easily be read into javascript on the browser. First preview uses head_df command to display only a restricted part of the dataframe ( head ) * columns_info command is used to get lit of columns and eventual tags * /api/build service is used to build valid queries from javascript lists. This could be implemented directly in javascript, build service is a way to remotely call liquer.parser.encode . Integration of libhxl (example of a custom state type) Pandas is great, but there are other good libraries too e.g. tabulate . If you want to to use other data type (tabular or other), it will typically require (besides some useful commands) defining how that data can be serialized. This is done by implementing a state type . State type does several things associated with state type handling, but the most important role is handling serialization and deserialization. One excelent library used for working with humanitarian data is libhxl . Libhxl plays somewhat similar role as pandas: it reads, writes and manipulates tabular data - but it does as well understand HXL , which pandas doesn't - hence the liquer.ext.lq_hxl module. In order to allow libhxl objects to be used in liquer, we need to define a state type: HxlStateType . import hxl from liquer.state_types import StateType, register_state_type, mimetype_from_extension class HxlStateType(StateType): def identifier(self): \"Define an unique string identifier for the state type\" return \"hxl_dataset\" The identifier is important e.g. for caching, where it is stored as a part of metadata and it tells what StateType should be used for deserialization. def default_extension(self): \"Default file extension for the state type\" return \"csv\" def is_type_of(self, data): \"Check if data is of this state type\" return isinstance(data, hxl.model.Dataset) Default extension is used when the extension is not specified otherwise - for example if query does not end with a filename. The as_bytes and from_bytes are two most important methods, which take care of the serialization and deserialization. A state data can be serialized into multiple formats (e.g. csv, html, json...), therefore as_bytes optionally accepts a file extension and returns (besides the bytes) as well the mimetype. Th mimetype (when queried through the liquer server) becomes a part of the web service response. Note that serialization and deserialization do not necessarily need to support the same formats. E.g. html is quite nice to support in serialization, but it is too unspecific for a deserialization. def as_bytes(self, data, extension=None): \"\"\"Serialize data as bytes File extension may be provided and influence the serialization format. \"\"\" if extension is None: extension = self.default_extension() assert self.is_type_of(data) mimetype = mimetype_from_extension(extension) if extension == \"csv\": output = \"\".join(data.gen_csv(show_headers=True, show_tags=True)) return output.encode(\"utf-8\"), mimetype elif extension == \"json\": output = \"\".join(data.gen_json(show_headers=True, show_tags=True)) return output.encode(\"utf-8\"), mimetype else: raise Exception( f\"Serialization: file extension {extension} is not supported by HXL dataset type.\") def from_bytes(self, b: bytes, extension=None): \"\"\"De-serialize data from bytes File extension may be provided and influence the serialization format. \"\"\" if extension is None: extension = self.default_extension() f = BytesIO() f.write(b) f.seek(0) if extension == \"csv\": return hxl.data(f) raise Exception( f\"Deserialization: file extension {extension} is not supported by HXL dataset type.\") Sometimes a deep copy of state data is needed - e.g. to assure that the data in the cache will not become unintentionally modified. That's why the state type should define copy method. Since libhxl dataset is immutable (?), it is OK to return just the data without making a copy. def copy(self, data): \"\"\"Make a deep copy of the data\"\"\" return data Once the state type class is defined, a state type instance is created and registered HXL_DATASET_STATE_TYPE = HxlStateType() register_state_type(hxl.Dataset, HXL_DATASET_STATE_TYPE) register_state_type(hxl.io.HXLReader, HXL_DATASET_STATE_TYPE) This is (currently) done for all relevant types. State types are registered in a global StateTypesRegistry object, which is responsible for registering and finding a state type instance for any state data. For more details see liquer.ext.lq_hxl module. Actually, the state type may not define a serialization and/or deserialization. There are objects that either can't be reliably serialized (e.g. matplotlib figure - as of time of writing) or serialization is otherwise undesirable. Such state types would be perfectly legal - they just could be neither cached nor served by the liquer web server. However, they could be inside the query, e.g. if matplotlib figure would be followed by image creation command, the image could be both served and cached. Reports and visualizations With the help of LiQuer, it is very easy to create both resuable visualizations with multiple views as well as documents viewable offline or suitable for printing. There are multiple markups suitable for creating reports and visualisations, but probably the easiest and most flexible are HTML documents. In LiQuer html can be easily created by returning a html text from a command. Creation of text is simplified by evaluate_template function, which processes a string ( template ) containing LiQuer queries and replaces those queries by their results. Report example is processing data from Global Food Prices Database (WFP) . It contains monthly prices for various commodities. To adapt the data to our needs we need a cople of extra commands: Month and year are in two separate columns mp_year and mp_month . For charts we need dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, which we achieve with the following command: @command def datemy(df,y=\"mp_year\",m=\"mp_month\",target=\"date\"): df.loc[:,target]=[\"%04d-%02d-01\"%(int(year),int(month)) for year,month in zip(df[y],df[m])] return df To make statistics, it's handy to use pandas groupby. As an example we show count of groups, which used in the report to show number of observed prices in various markets: @command def count(df, *groupby_columns): df.loc[:,\"count\"]=1 return df.groupby(groupby_columns).count().reset_index().loc[:,list(groupby_columns)+[\"count\"]] An example of a custom filter is a greater or equal command geq , used in the report to cut away years before a start year: @command def geq(df, column, value:float): index = df.loc[:,column] >= value return df.loc[index,:] This is somewhat similar to eq command from the pandas support module liquer.ext.lq_pandas , but only supports numerical values, while the eq command is somewhat more general. Pandas dataframe supports quite flexible method to_html for converting dataframes to html format. Report uses for styling the popular css framework bootstrap and to display the tables nicely we just need to add some bootstrap css classes . Command as well prepends a link to the dataframe itself by the link command. This tends to be very useful in practice, allowing to conviniently import underlying raw data into a spreadsheet. @command def table(state): df = state.get() html=evaluate_template(f\"\"\"<a href=\"${state.query}/link-url-csv$\">(data)</a> \"\"\") return html+df.to_html(index=False, classes=\"table table-striped\") The core of the report is a report command. It can be applied on any dataframe containing suitable fields. This allows a large degree of flexibility - arbitrary filters can be inserted into a command chain before the report. For example, the current report can be restricted to specific markets, time periods or commodities without any additional code, just by modifying the URL. Report embeds a possibility to remove data pefore a from_year . This in principle could be done by inserting a geq command before the report (which would work fine). Passing from_year as an argument has an advantage, that the start year can become a part of the report (e.g. it can be used as a part of the title). Main part of the report is a single template, evaluated with evaluate_template . Note that LiQuer template uses as well string interpolation by python f string (PEP 498) , which is a very powerful combination. @command def report(state, from_year=2017, linktype=None): state = state.with_caching(False) def makelink(url): if linktype is None: return url extension = url.split(\".\")[-1] return evaluate(f\"fetch-{encode_token(url)}/link-{linktype}-{extension}\").get() try: source = state.sources[0] except: source = \"???\" LiQuer='<a href=\"https://github.com/orest-d/liquer\">&nbsp;LiQuer&nbsp;</a>' df = state.get() try: title = \",\".join(sorted(df.adm0_name.unique())) + f\" since {from_year}\" except: title = \"report\" return state.with_filename(\"report.html\").with_data(evaluate_template(f\"\"\" <html> <head> <title>{title}</title> <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no\"> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{makelink('https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css')}\" integrity=\"sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"> </head> <body> <div class=\"p-3 mb-2 bg-success text-white fixed-top shadow-sm\"> <a class=\"nav-link active\" href=\"https://data.humdata.org\"><img src=\"{makelink('https://centre.humdata.org/wp-content/uploads/hdx_new_logo_accronym2.png')}\" style=\"height:30px;\" alt=\"HDX\"></a> </div> <div class=\"bg-light fixed-bottom border-top\"> Generated with {LiQuer} <span class=\"float-right\">&#169; 2019 Orest Dubay</span> </div> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <h1>{title}</h1> <div class=\"container-fluid\"> <div class=\"row\"> Data originate from <a href=\"{source}\">&nbsp;{source}&nbsp;</a> were processed via a {LiQuer} service.

Links are created by a nested function makelink . The main purpose is to allow three different regimes of working with links: * links to original sources (default), * serving (proxying) resources through LiQuer service and * dataurls. Links to original sources are useful if the report is used from a web service: the report size is then relatively small and thus the loading time is faster than for dataurls. Proxying resources through LiQuer service allows to cache resources by LiQuer. This may be useful on slower internet connections, when running the service without internet or behind a firewall. Dataurl link type allows saving the report as a single html file. Such a report can be used e.g. for offline browsing, archiving or sending by e-mail. All the assets are embedded inside the html file, so the report will work even when the LiQuer service is not available. Note: The embedded LiQuer queries will of course not work offline, but if necessary, the data comming out from LiQuer can be turned to a dataurl with link command; type of the link can be controlled by linktype state variable. Assuming linktype is not hardcoded (as in table command) all query links in the report could be turned to dataurls like this: filter-params/let-linktype-dataurl/report This of course could lead to extremply large report files, so it should be used carefully.","title":"Examples"},{"location":"examples/#hdx-disaggregation-wizard","text":"LiQuer is a small server-side framework that can be quite helpful when building data-oriented web applications.

In order to allow libhxl objects to be used in liquer, we need to define a state type: HxlStateType . import hxl from liquer.state_types import StateType, register_state_type, mimetype_from_extension class HxlStateType(StateType): def identifier(self): \"Define an unique string identifier for the state type\" return \"hxl_dataset\" The identifier is important e.g. for caching, where it is stored as a part of metadata and it tells what StateType should be used for deserialization. def default_extension(self): \"Default file extension for the state type\" return \"csv\" def is_type_of(self, data): \"Check if data is of this state type\" return isinstance(data, hxl.model.Dataset) Default extension is used when the extension is not specified otherwise - for example if query does not end with a filename. The as_bytes and from_bytes are two most important methods, which take care of the serialization and deserialization. A state data can be serialized into multiple formats (e.g. csv, html, json...), therefore as_bytes optionally accepts a file extension and returns (besides the bytes) as well the mimetype. Th mimetype (when queried through the liquer server) becomes a part of the web service response. Note that serialization and deserialization do not necessarily need to support the same formats. E.g. html is quite nice to support in serialization, but it is too unspecific for a deserialization. def as_bytes(self, data, extension=None): \"\"\"Serialize data as bytes File extension may be provided and influence the serialization format. \"\"\" if extension is None: extension = self.default_extension() assert self.is_type_of(data) mimetype = mimetype_from_extension(extension) if extension == \"csv\": output = \"\".join(data.gen_csv(show_headers=True, show_tags=True)) return output.encode(\"utf-8\"), mimetype elif extension == \"json\": output = \"\".join(data.gen_json(show_headers=True, show_tags=True)) return output.encode(\"utf-8\"), mimetype else: raise Exception( f\"Serialization: file extension {extension} is not supported by HXL dataset type.\") def from_bytes(self, b: bytes, extension=None): \"\"\"De-serialize data from bytes File extension may be provided and influence the serialization format. \"\"\" if extension is None: extension = self.default_extension() f = BytesIO() f.write(b) f.seek(0) if extension == \"csv\": return hxl.data(f) raise Exception( f\"Deserialization: file extension {extension} is not supported by HXL dataset type.\") Sometimes a deep copy of state data is needed - e.g. to assure that the data in the cache will not become unintentionally modified. That's why the state type should define copy method. Since libhxl dataset is immutable (?), it is OK to return just the data without making a copy. def copy(self, data): \"\"\"Make a deep copy of the data\"\"\" return data Once the state type class is defined, a state type instance is created and registered HXL_DATASET_STATE_TYPE = HxlStateType() register_state_type(hxl.Dataset, HXL_DATASET_STATE_TYPE) register_state_type(hxl.io.HXLReader, HXL_DATASET_STATE_TYPE) This is (currently) done for all relevant types. State types are registered in a global StateTypesRegistry object, which is responsible for registering and finding a state type instance for any state data. For more details see liquer.ext.lq_hxl module. Actually, the state type may not define a serialization and/or deserialization. There are objects that either can't be reliably serialized (e.g. matplotlib figure - as of time of writing) or serialization is otherwise undesirable. Such state types would be perfectly legal - they just could be neither cached nor served by the liquer web server. However, they could be inside the query, e.g. if matplotlib figure would be followed by image creation command, the image could be both served and cached.","title":"Integration of libhxl (example of a custom state type)"},{"location":"examples/#reports-and-visualizations","text":"With the help of LiQuer, it is very easy to create both resuable visualizations with multiple views as well as documents viewable offline or suitable for printing. There are multiple markups suitable for creating reports and visualisations, but probably the easiest and most flexible are HTML documents. In LiQuer html can be easily created by returning a html text from a command. Creation of text is simplified by evaluate_template function, which processes a string ( template ) containing LiQuer queries and replaces those queries by their results. Report example is processing data from Global Food Prices Database (WFP) . It contains monthly prices for various commodities. To adapt the data to our needs we need a cople of extra commands: Month and year are in two separate columns mp_year and mp_month . For charts we need dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, which we achieve with the following command: @command def datemy(df,y=\"mp_year\",m=\"mp_month\",target=\"date\"): df.loc[:,target]=[\"%04d-%02d-01\"%(int(year),int(month)) for year,month in zip(df[y],df[m])] return df To make statistics, it's handy to use pandas groupby. As an example we show count of groups, which used in the report to show number of observed prices in various markets: @command def count(df, *groupby_columns): df.loc[:,\"count\"]=1 return df.groupby(groupby_columns).count().reset_index().loc[:,list(groupby_columns)+[\"count\"]] An example of a custom filter is a greater or equal command geq , used in the report to cut away years before a start year: @command def geq(df, column, value:float): index = df.loc[:,column] >= value return df.loc[index,:] This is somewhat similar to eq command from the pandas support module liquer.ext.lq_pandas , but only supports numerical values, while the eq command is somewhat more general. Pandas dataframe supports quite flexible method to_html for converting dataframes to html format. Report uses for styling the popular css framework bootstrap and to display the tables nicely we just need to add some bootstrap css classes . Command as well prepends a link to the dataframe itself by the link command. This tends to be very useful in practice, allowing to conviniently import underlying raw data into a spreadsheet. @command def table(state): df = state.get() html=evaluate_template(f\"\"\"<a href=\"${state.query}/link-url-csv$\">(data)</a> \"\"\") return html+df.to_html(index=False, classes=\"table table-striped\") The core of the report is a report command. It can be applied on any dataframe containing suitable fields. This allows a large degree of flexibility - arbitrary filters can be inserted into a command chain before the report. For example, the current report can be restricted to specific markets, time periods or commodities without any additional code, just by modifying the URL. Report embeds a possibility to remove data pefore a from_year . This in principle could be done by inserting a geq command before the report (which would work fine). Passing from_year as an argument has an advantage, that the start year can become a part of the report (e.g. it can be used as a part of the title). Main part of the report is a single template, evaluated with evaluate_template . Note that LiQuer template uses as well string interpolation by python f string (PEP 498) , which is a very powerful combination. @command def report(state, from_year=2017, linktype=None): state = state.with_caching(False) def makelink(url): if linktype is None: return url extension = url.split(\".\")[-1] return evaluate(f\"fetch-{encode_token(url)}/link-{linktype}-{extension}\").get() try: source = state.sources[0] except: source = \"???\" LiQuer='<a href=\"https://github.com/orest-d/liquer\">&nbsp;LiQuer&nbsp;</a>' df = state.get() try: title = \",\".join(sorted(df.adm0_name.unique())) + f\" since {from_year}\" except: title = \"report\" return state.with_filename(\"report.html\").with_data(evaluate_template(f\"\"\" <html> <head> <title>{title}</title> <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no\"> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{makelink('https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css')}\" integrity=\"sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"> </head> <body> <div class=\"p-3 mb-2 bg-success text-white fixed-top shadow-sm\"> <a class=\"nav-link active\" href=\"https://data.humdata.org\"><img src=\"{makelink('https://centre.humdata.org/wp-content/uploads/hdx_new_logo_accronym2.png')}\" style=\"height:30px;\" alt=\"HDX\"></a> </div> <div class=\"bg-light fixed-bottom border-top\"> Generated with {LiQuer} <span class=\"float-right\">&#169; 2019 Orest Dubay</span> </div> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <h1>{title}</h1> <div class=\"container-fluid\"> <div class=\"row\"> Data originate from <a href=\"{source}\">&nbsp;{source}&nbsp;</a> were processed via a {LiQuer} service.

Links are created by a nested function makelink . The main purpose is to allow three different regimes of working with links: * links to original sources (default), * serving (proxying) resources through LiQuer service and * dataurls. Links to original sources are useful if the report is used from a web service: the report size is then relatively small and thus the loading time is faster than for dataurls. Proxying resources through LiQuer service allows to cache resources by LiQuer. This may be useful on slower internet connections, when running the service without internet or behind a firewall. Dataurl link type allows saving the report as a single html file. Such a report can be used e.g. for offline browsing, archiving or sending by e-mail. All the assets are embedded inside the html file, so the report will work even when the LiQuer service is not available. Note: The embedded LiQuer queries will of course not work offline, but if necessary, the data comming out from LiQuer can be turned to a dataurl with link command; type of the link can be controlled by linktype state variable. Assuming linktype is not hardcoded (as in table command) all query links in the report could be turned to dataurls like this: filter-params/let-linktype-dataurl/report This of course could lead to extremply large report files, so it should be used carefully.","title":"Reports and visualizations"},{"location":"guide/","text":"Instalation LiQuer requires at least python 3.6 with flask. It can be installed by python3 -m pip install liquer-framework Alternatively you can get LiQuer from repository : git clone https://github.com/orest-d/liquer.git python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate cd liquer python3 setup.py install Hello, world! The good tradition is to start with a Hello, world! example: from liquer import * @first_command def hello(): return \"Hello\" @command def greet(greeting, who=\"world\"): return f\"{greeting}, {who}!\" print (evaluate(\"hello/greet\").get()) print (evaluate(\"hello/greet-everybody\").get()) A server version of the same example: from liquer import * ### Create Flask app and register LiQuer blueprint from flask import Flask import liquer.blueprint as bp app = Flask(__name__) app.register_blueprint(bp.app, url_prefix='/liquer') @first_command def hello(): return \"Hello\" @command def greet(greeting, who=\"world\"): return f\"{greeting}, {who}!\" if __name__ == '__main__': app.run() This is a normal flask server, registering LiQuer blueprint which makes all the LiQuer functionality available in the web service. Commands By decorating a function with @command or @first_command , the function is registered in a command registry. Function is only registered, not modified or wrapped in any way - therefore it can be used as if it would not be decorated at all. Commands (command functions) typically need to be enabled in a LiQuer application simply by importing a module with command-decorated functions. Built-in modules need to be imported as well - this gives control about enabled features and as well allows to limit dependencies (e.g. in principle LiQuer application only requires pandas when liquer.ext.lq_pandas is imported.) When a command function is registered, metadata are extracted based on available informations and conventions: Function name becomes a name of the command. Modules can not be distinguished inside the query, therefore command (and hence functions) should have unique names even when they are defined in multiple modules. When decorated with @command , the first argument of the function will always be a state. If the first argument is called state , command function will receive the state as an instance of State , otherwise it will be just plain data. Plain data can be obtained from state by state.get() . When decorated with @first_command , command will not receive a state at all. Command registration tries to identify all the arguments and their types. The types are guessed either from type annotations (if available) or from default values. Default values and *args are suported, the **kwargs are not supported in commands. Parsed string arguments are converted to estimated types before they are passed to the command. This is done with help of argument parsers (see liquer.commands.ArgumentParser ). Command function may return any data type. If it does not return an instance of State , the returned data is automatically wrapped as a State when evaluated. The main purpose of State instance is to add metadata to the data (e.g. the query executed sofar, data sources used, type of the data, file name). It as well provides a logging functionality, which can record messages and errors during the execution of the query. See liquer.state for more info. Security LiQuer was so far only deployed on intranet. More development is needed to make interent deployment of LiQuer safe. LiQuer exposes only services defined in the liquer.blueprint module - and by extension all the registered commands. Only enable commands that do not put your system to risk. A big source of security concerns are DOS attacks: * It is easy to overload LiQuer server with huge queries. To solve this issue, queries need to be validated in some way. * Badly implemented cache may quickly exceed the storage capacity. (Default NoCache is a safe choice in this respect.) Working with pandas Pandas example: from liquer import * import liquer.ext.lq_pandas @first_command def data(): return pd.DataFrame(dict(a=[1, 2, 3], b=[40, 50, 60])) @command def sum_columns(df, column1=\"a\", column2=\"b\", target=\"c\"): df.loc[:, target] = df[column1]+df[column2] return df When queried via a web interface, the data is automatically converted to a most suitable format. If the last element of a query is a command without arguments containing a dot in the name, it is interpreted as a file name and the extension is used to determine the format. The format conversion only happens when query is run over the service, not when using the evaluate function. data - default format is used (which is csv) data/data.html - data is converted to html and displayed in the browser data/data.csv - data is converted to csv data/data.xlsx - dataframe is converted to xlsx data/eq-b-50 - built in equality filter selects rows with b==50 data/sum_columns - sum_columns is applied to a dataframe; this is equivalent to sum_columns(data()) data/sum_columns/sum_columns-a-c-d/sum2.html - multiple actions are chained: sum_columns(sum_columns(data()),\"a\",\"c\",\"d\") and result is served as html. df_from-URL - built in command loads a dataframe from URL Charts LiQuer has a rudimentary support for matplotlib and plotly residing in packages liquer.ext.lq_matplotlib and liquer.ext.lq_plotly Examples are in matplotlib_chart.py and plotly_chart.py show how to make simple plots with the commands already built in. This functionality is very basic at the moment and is likely to change. Encoding and decoding In many cases, particularly when supplying a URL as a parameter to a query, some charactes need to be escaped. A comprehensive example shows two ways how to do it: from liquer import * from liquer.parser import encode, encode_token import liquer.ext.lq_pandas url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orest-d/liquer/master/tests/test.csv\" query = encode([[\"df_from\",url]]) # encode complete query print (f\"Query: {query}\") # Query: df_from-~Hraw.githubusercontent.com~Iorest~_d~Iliquer~Imaster~Itests~Itest.csv print (evaluate(query).get()) query = \"df_from-\"+encode_token(url) # encode a single token of the query print (f\"Query: {query}\") print (evaluate(query).get()) A query is a list of commands; each command being a list of strings ( tokens ). The first string token in a command is the name of the command and the rest are the parameters. A string token is simply a string which can be escaped by encode_token and unescaped by decode_token . A decoded query is simply a list of lists of strings. To convert a decoded query to a string ( encoded query ) use encode , for the inverse operation use decode . The encode can as well be done via a web service by api/build (see liquer/blueprint ). State variables In some situations it is useful to pass some values along the query. For example if we want to specify some value once and use it in multiple commands. from liquer import * from liquer.state import set_var import liquer.ext.basic @command def hello(state, who=None): if who is None: who = state.vars.get(\"greet\",\"???\") return f\"Hello, {who}!\" set_var(\"greet\",\"world\") print (evaluate(\"hello\").get()) # Hello, world! : uses state variable defined above print (evaluate(\"state_variable-greet\").get()) # world : shows the content of the state variable print (evaluate(\"hello-everybody\").get()) # Hello, everybody! : uses the argument print (evaluate(\"let-greet-variable/hello\").get()) # Hello, variable! : defines the variable in the query print (evaluate(\"hello\").get()) # Hello, world! : let is local to a query There are two variables that are important to set up in some cases: * server should contain the URL of the LiQuer server * api_path should contain the path to the query service So server + api_path + query should become a valid url that would yield a query result. Several commands (e.g. link or split_df) depend on correct definition of these variables, so they should be set together with setting up the flask blueprint - e.g. url_prefix='/liquer' app.register_blueprint(bp.app, url_prefix=url_prefix) set_var(\"api_path\",url_prefix+\"/q/\") set_var(\"server\",\"http://localhost:5000\") Cache By default there is no cache - i.e. the queries are always re-evaluated. There are several cache implementations available in liquer.cache . They are configured by set_cache function, for example set_cache(FileCache(\"cache\")) configures a cache that will store all the (chache-able) results of queries in a dictionary cache . Cache should be configured before the queries are evaluated - and before state variables are set. Currently there are three cache implementations: NoCache is a trivial do-nothing cache, FileCache stores data in files, MemoryCache caches the object in the memory. Custom cache can be created by defining a cache interface, see above mentioned classes. Cache will typically use query as a key and utilize the mechanism of serializing data into a bytes sequence (defined in liquer.state_types ), thus implementing a cache based either on a key-value store or blob-storage in SQL databases should be fairly straightforward (and probably quite similar to FileCache ). Command may optionally decide not to cache its output. This may be useful when command produces volatile data, e.g. time. In such a case command (operating on a state) can disable cache by state.with_caching(False) .","title":"General guide"},{"location":"guide/#instalation","text":"LiQuer requires at least python 3.6 with flask.

Action is nothing else than a function (closure) with all arguments specified except the first one. All actions consume a single input and produce a single output - so they can be chained into a pipeline. In the Hello, world! example from earlier, the hello/greet-everybody is a sequence of two actions. The first action is hello does not have any explicit parameters. (Technically it accepts an input - but that input is ignored, so this function is suitable to be at the beginning of the pipeline.) The greet-everybody is and action calling a command greet with an argument \"everybody\". The general structure of a query is actions are separated by \"/\", arguments are separated by \"-\": identifier1-arg11-arg12/identifier2-arg21-arg22-arg23/identifier3-arg31... Action starts with an identifier, which is interpreted as a command name. In practice, the command is always defined via a python function with the same name. Therefore identifier must be a valid python identifier plus it can't start with an upper case. Thus \"my_command\" is a valid identifier, but \"MyCommand\", \"1command\" or \"my.command\" is not. Query is optionaly terminated by a filename. A valid filename must fulfill the following conditions: Filename is the last element in a query, i.e. there is no \"/\" after the filename. Filename must contain \".\". Filename can not contain \"-\". These rules assure that a filename can be recognized from a command name or an argument. For example readme.txt is a valid filename, but readme-now.txt would be interpreted as an action composed from a command readme with an argument \"now.txt\". The main role of a filename is to specify the file extension, which determines the format in which the data are serialized when saved or returned via a web interface. The filename before the extension is arbitrary. Escaping and query entities Query only allows to use the characters allowed in the path part of the URL, and the following characters have a special meaning: slash \"/\" separates the actions, dash \"-\" separates action arguments and query segments, tilde \"~\" is used as an escape character. There are two mechanisms that can be used for escaping: * Percentage encoding used for encoding special characters in URL - see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding * Query entities are constructs starting with the tilde character \"~\". Query entities have special meaning, e.g. they can be used for encoding of \"-\", \"/\" and \"~\". Though encoding of these characters with the percentage encoding might work as well, it is safer to use query entities (tilde encoding). The following entities are defined: tilde entity \"~~\" expands to \"~\" minus entity \"~_\" expands to \"-\" slash entities \"~I\" and \"~/\" expand to \"/\" https entity \"~H\" expands to \"https://\" http entity \"~h\" expands to \"http://\" file entity \"~f\" expands to \"file://\" protocol entity \"~P\" expands to \"://\" negative number entities \"~0\",\"~1\",\"~2\" ... \"~9\" expand to \"-0\", \"-1\", \"-2\" ... \"-9\". (This is a more convenient alternative syntax for writing negative numbers like \"~123\" instead of \"~_123\". space entity \"~.\" expands to \" \" expand entity \"~X~ query ~E\" evaluates the query and expands to a result end_entity \"~E\" is not a real entity, but can only be part of a complex entity like the expand entity . Expand entity supports two types of queries - absolute starting with \"/\" and relative (not starting with \"/\"). Absolute entities are simply evaluated as they are, but relative entities are pre-pended with the current query before the execution. For example hello/greet-~X~/everybody~E is interpreted as greet(hello(), everybody()) , but the relative query in an argument hello/greet-~X~everybody~E is interpreted as greet(hello(), everybody(hello())) .","title":"Query syntax"},{"location":"query/#query","text":"","title":"Query"},{"location":"query/#basic-query","text":"Query is in the simplest case composed out of a sequence of actions. Action is nothing else than a function (closure) with all arguments specified except the first one. All actions consume a single input and produce a single output - so they can be chained into a pipeline. In the Hello, world! example from earlier, the hello/greet-everybody is a sequence of two actions. The first action is hello does not have any explicit parameters. (Technically it accepts an input - but that input is ignored, so this function is suitable to be at the beginning of the pipeline.) The greet-everybody is and action calling a command greet with an argument \"everybody\". The general structure of a query is actions are separated by \"/\", arguments are separated by \"-\": identifier1-arg11-arg12/identifier2-arg21-arg22-arg23/identifier3-arg31... Action starts with an identifier, which is interpreted as a command name. In practice, the command is always defined via a python function with the same name. Therefore identifier must be a valid python identifier plus it can't start with an upper case. Thus \"my_command\" is a valid identifier, but \"MyCommand\", \"1command\" or \"my.command\" is not. Query is optionaly terminated by a filename. A valid filename must fulfill the following conditions: Filename is the last element in a query, i.e. there is no \"/\" after the filename. Filename must contain \".\". Filename can not contain \"-\". These rules assure that a filename can be recognized from a command name or an argument. For example readme.txt is a valid filename, but readme-now.txt would be interpreted as an action composed from a command readme with an argument \"now.txt\". The main role of a filename is to specify the file extension, which determines the format in which the data are serialized when saved or returned via a web interface.
